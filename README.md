   - Admin reviews the parcel request in the admin dashboard
   - Admin can approve or update the status
   - Once approved, status changes to: **"Approved"**

   - Receiver can track the parcel status in real-time

4. **Admin Updates Status to Dispatched**

   - Admin can further update to: **"In Transit"**

5. **Sender Edit/Cancel Permissions**

   - Cancellation is only allowed for statuses: "Requested" or "Approved"

6. **Parcel In Transit**
   - Admin updates status to: **"In Transit"**
   - Receiver can see real-time updates

7. **Delivery Confirmation**
   - **Only when status is "In Transit"**: Receiver can confirm delivery
